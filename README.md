#HTTP Proxy Server
This is a simple HTTP proxy server implemented in Python. It listens for incoming connections on a specified port and receives HTTP request messages from clients. If the requested URL is not in a list of blocked URLs, the server attempts to retrieve the requested file from the cache directory. If the file is found in the cache, it is sent to the client. If the file is not found in the cache, the server creates a socket and connects to the host specified in the request message, sends an HTTP request for the file, and receives the response. The response is then stored in a cache file and also sent to the client. If an error occurs while trying to retrieve the file, an HTTP error message is sent to the client.

Usage
To run the proxy server, use the following command:

Copy code
python ProxyServer.py server_ip
Where server_ip is the IP address of the proxy server.

Configuration
The list of blocked URLs is stored in a file called urlfilter.txt. To add or remove URLs from the list, edit this file.

The cache directory is called cache. The cache files are stored in this directory and are named after the requested URL.

Dependencies
This script requires the socket module, which is a built-in Python module. No other dependencies are required.

Notes
This proxy server is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment. It has not been thoroughly tested and may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities.
